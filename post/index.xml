      <description>Why? Our VMUG did not have a presenter lined up so I figured it was time to pay my &amp;ldquo;dues&amp;rdquo; so to speak. I quickly came up with the idea of covering #BackToTheBasics inside of VMWare related to performance. This included vNuma, ESXTOP, and snapshots which I have found have been heavy-hitting performance issues in my environments. This seemed like a great time to brush up on my first presentation since high school that wasn&#39;t me just blabbering and rambling through 5-10 mins how-to for a group of people.</description>

      <description>The Professional Story Over 12 years in IT doing various jobs all the way from Helpdesk to IT Systems Administrator over a VMware Infrastructure. I have worked for small Mom &amp;amp; Pop shops all the way up to the big fruit company. Over the years I have developed an awesome set of skills and a great collection of random knowledge but the thing I took away from every job/Client site that I have been at is the ability to step back and do logical problem solving.</description>
