For streamlined assistance, initiating a support ticket is a straightforward process. Simply send an email to help@brantlab.com, and your account will be promptly generated. If you prefer to manage your requests online, you have the option to reset your password at {{<extlink text="helpdesk.brantlab.com" href="https://helpdesk.brantlab.com">}}. By doing so, you gain access to a user-friendly platform where you can view your tickets and monitor their status.

However, if navigating an online portal isn't your preference, worry not. You can seamlessly handle all aspects of your support ticket directly through email communication. Whether you choose the web-based platform or the convenience of your email inbox, our commitment remains the same â€“ providing efficient and effective solutions to meet your needs.
