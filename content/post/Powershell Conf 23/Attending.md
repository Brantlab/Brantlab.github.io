## What did I get into?

I use Powershell day in and day out in my daily role. This conference made a lot of sense to attend but what I didn’t realize is I am more of a utility scripter and the conference had a big DevOps focus this year but that is how Powershell is heading as a whole. This mindset is a change for me and how I use my scripts by focusing more on reusable code such as functions and parameters vs hard coding information.

## More intimate conference

There would be between 200 and 300 attendees (strictly a guess) so this made it very easy to drum up conversation between sessions and the sessions appear to be more by users than companies. My “big” conference is VMworld or now known as VMware Explore but the sessions there are centered around giant business. Out of thousands of sessions at the last VMware explore I found more than 50% of them dealt with 5G telecommunications technologies which baffled me. I find myself attending community sessions more than anything else but I spend the majority networking with other IT professionals more than looking for my next session. PowerShell Summit was very nice for finding sessions as it seemed I always wanted to be in 2 or 3 at a time on a 4 session track.
