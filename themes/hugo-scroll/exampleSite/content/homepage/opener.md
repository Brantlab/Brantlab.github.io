`Hugo-Scroll` theme alternates colors of sections that are placed on single page. 
The landing screen is meant to be visually striking.

Single-page approach is oriented towards small to medium content length, that won't overwhelm the user. 
You can also delegate lengthier, less important or more sizeable content to [dedicated pages](services).
